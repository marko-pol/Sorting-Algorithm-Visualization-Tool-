Data Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is an interactive data visualization tool built with Python and Tkinter that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. It allows users to watch sorting processes unfold step-by-step, making it a helpful resource for learning and teaching computer science fundamentals.

✨ Features

🔹 Visualizes the sorting process in real-time with dynamic bar charts.

🔹 Supports multiple sorting algorithms:

    🔹Bubble Sort

    🔹Merge Sort

    🔹Bucket Sort

    🔹Insertion Sort

🔹 Adjustable speed to control visualization playback.

🔹 Randomized datasets for each run to keep demonstrations fresh.

🔹 Simple, lightweight Tkinter interface for easy use.

🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to make abstract algorithm concepts easier to understand by transforming them into engaging visual animations. It’s designed for:

🔹Students learning algorithms

🔹Teachers explaining algorithm behavior

🔹Developers refreshing their knowledge
